# SMS-SPAM-DETECTOR
The SMS Spam Detector is a machine learning-based project aimed at identifying and filtering out spam messages from SMS text data. With the rise in unsolicited and potentially harmful spam messages, this tool provides a reliable and efficient way to classify messages as either "Spam" or "Ham" (non-spam).
